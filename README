HOW TO RUN
----------
Make sure cmake and make are installed, then run:

    ./test.sh

This will also run some predefined tests. To run the test on a specific file, run:

    ./test.sh file

FEATURES
--------
- The class 'CompressedByteArray' encapsulates the compressed sequence. It allows
  constant time random access using the overloaded indexing operator. This design
  allows the sequence to be accessed like normal arrays.
- The number of bits needed per symbol is chosen dynamically instead of hardcoded,
  allowing arbitrary files and also providing better compression for files with few
  unique symbols.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
- The algorithm is not on-the-fly, it needs to scan the whole file first in order
  to find the lowest number of bits that can represent every symbol.
- The number of bits per symbol is fixed, not adaptive. A few infrequent symbols
  can make the compressed file much bigger.
- Slow speed on large files, because of inefficient bit-by-bit processing.
- mmap could have been used to avoid loading the whole file in memory.
- Ad-hoc testing system.
